# Training loop
1) Add MSE to Tensorboard (alredy computed as train_acc and val_acc) (maybe RMSE?)
2) Save model

# Overview
1) Add arguments and functionalities for running in evaluation mode...

# Figures
1) Calibration plots
2) Other ways to visualize learning uncertainties

# BASELINE
1) How do we do uncertainty here?

# Experiments
- Debug to plot to investigate why there is no aleatoric uncertainty???

1) What happens when we increase lambda much?
2) What happens when we decrease lambda much?
3) What happens when we increase the noise of the data much? (aleatoric)
4) What happens when we derease the noise of the data much? (aleatoric?)
