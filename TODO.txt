# Normal Inverse-Gamma distribution
1) Implement the loss function
2) Implement as a child-class of torch.Distribution
    2.1) s.t. sampling, calling the model properties, etc. is possible


# Cross-product
1) Implement 3D cross product


# Training loop
1) Add batch loop
2) Add MSE to Tensorboard (alredy computed as train_acc and val_acc) (maybe RMSE?)
